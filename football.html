        <h1>About the Sport:</h1>
        <p>Football is a very interesting game. It involves players from each side kicking a ball and making it pass into a netted goal. Each team has 11 players (1 goalkeeper and 10 outfielders) who play on the field, along with substitutes who can be replaced (as suggested by their name). Professional teams also have team managers, assistant managers, and other staff for medical and miscellaneous tasks.</p> 
        <h1>Basic Rules:</h1>
        <p>A football match lasts 90 minutes, played in two halves of 45 minutes each. Professional matches also include "Added Time," which consists of a few minutes added to compensate for time wasted during the half. To win, a team must score more goals than the opposing team. In case of an equal number of goals, the match ends as a "Draw."</p>
