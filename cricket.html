        <h1>About the Sport:</h1>
        <p>Cricket is a very interesting game. It involves two teams — one has to defend the wickets, while the other has to hit them. Each team has 11 players. The bowling side includes one wicketkeeper, one bowler, and nine outfielders who play on the field. Professional teams also have team managers, assistant managers, and other staff for medical and miscellaneous tasks.</p>
        <h1>Basic Rules:</h1>
        <p>At any point in the game, a bowler has to bowl at least 6 balls (6 correctly delivered balls equal 1 over) and try to get the batsman out. This can be done either by hitting the wickets, catching the ball hit by the bat, the batsman’s leg blocking the wicket, or through a run-out. Each team has 10 wickets, meaning if all 10 men are out the innings are over. Each match is divided in different number of Innings based on the format. A cricket match can be played in three different formats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test Match</li>
                <li>One Day international (ODI)</li>
                <li>Twenty 20 (T20)</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these formats have different amount of overs:  
            <ul>
                <li>Test Match: Unlimited (till session)</li>
                <li>One Day international (ODI): 50 Overs</li>
                <li>Twenty 20 (T20): 20 Overs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Tournaments:</h1>
        <h2>World Cup:</h2>
        <p>The Cricket World Cup is played by international teams. Countries like India, Australia, England, and Pakistan have won the World Cup on several occasions, with Australia winning the most - five times. The Cricket World Cup also is based on different formats but the main one is ODI World Cup.</p>
